# Tail Recursion

In the lectures, we've seen code for a recursive implementation for computing
the Fibonacci numbers. Make this implementation tail-recursive. I have not
provided a template; depending on how you choose to implement the function, it
will have a different signature. I have also not provided any test code, but you
can base yours on test code from other exercises.

Hint: It may help to have a look at the iterative dynamic programming
implementation. What changes between iterations of the loop?

## Runtime Analysis

Is the asymptotic complexity of tail-recursive Fibonacci different from the
non-tail-recursive version? Why, or why not? Add your answer, including your
reasoning, to this markdown file.

## Runtime Analysis

The asymptotic complexity of tail-recursive Fibonacci is the same as the non-tail-recursive version. This is because they both need to do the same amount of work to get the answer. Since they do the same amount of work just in different ways they have the same complexity. So the complexity would be $\Theta$ n.
